            <h2>Why I made this trash :(</h2>
            <p>Hey! I'm AP and I created this site as a little project, i intially wanted it to be similar to Poki online games and CoolMathGames and such, but integrating other peoples open source games into my website was a little cumbersome and i wanted this to be a weekend project while not spending all my time in front of my computer. So now i just have a few half-baked html games on here and i hope you enjoy them i will add more projects on here later ive been thinking of creating a 2d platformer and a 3d open world game on Godot not happening any time soon though so dont hold your breath i will be fixing these buggy html games though i may or may not get rid of this self deprecating shit as well lmk on the reddit thread, i may just be talking to my self right now and no one will ever read this who knows...</p>
